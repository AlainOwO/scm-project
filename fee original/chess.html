	<h1>Chess</h1>
	<h2>History</h2>
	<p>Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard, a square checkered gameboard with 64 squares
        arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. It is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people 
        worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Each player begins the game with
        sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Each of the six piece 
        types moves differently. Pieces are used to attack and capture the opponent's pieces, with the objective to 
        'checkmate' the opponent's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture. In addition to checkmate, 
        the game can be won by the voluntary resignation of the opponent, which typically occurs when too much material 
        is lost, or if checkmate appears unavoidable. A game may also result in a draw in several ways, where neither player 
        wins. The course of the game is divided into three phases: opening, middlegame, and endgame.</p>
	<h2>Rules</h2>
	<p>Along with information on official chess tournaments, the rules are described in the FIDE Handbook, Laws of Chess
        section. Chess is played on a square board of eight rows (called ranks and denoted with numbers 1 to 8) and eight 
        columns (called files and denoted with letters a to h) of squares.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Chess is believed to have originated in northwest India during the Gupta empire, where its early form in the 6th 
        century was known as chaturanga  (Sanskrit: four divisions [of the military]  infantry, cavalry, elephants, and 
        chariotry, represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, 
        respectively). According to both Chess historians Gerhard Josten and Isaak Linder "the early beginnings" of chess
        can be traced back to the Kushan Empire in Ancient Afghanistan (G. Josten, Chess - a living fossil). The earliest evidence 
        of chess is found in the neighboring Sassanid Persia around 600, where the game came to be known by the name chatrang.
        Chatrang is evoked in three epic romances written in Pahlavi (Middle Persian). Chatrang was taken up by the Muslim world
        after the Islamic conquest of Persia (633 AD 644), where it was then named shatranj, with the pieces largely retaining
        their Persian names. In Spanish "shatranj" was rendered as ajedrez ("al-shatranj"), in Portuguese as xadrez, and in 
        Greek as (zatrikion, which comes directly from the Persian chatrang), but in the rest of Europe it was replaced by versions 
        of the Persian shah ("king"), which was familiar as an exclamation and became the English words "check" and "chess". Murray 
        theorized that Muslim traders came to European seaports with ornamental chess kings as curios before they brought the game of chess.
        The game reached Western Europe and Russia by at least three routes, the earliest being in the 9th century. By the year 1000 it had 
        spread throughout Europe. Introduced into the Iberian Peninsula by the Moors in the 10th century, it was described in a famous 
        13th-century manuscript covering shatranj, backgammon, and dice named the Libro de los juegos. Another theory contends that chess 
        arose from the game xiangqi (Chinese Chess) or one of its predecessors, although this has been contested.
        Around 1200, the rules of shatranj started to be modified in southern Europe, and around 1475, several major
        changes made the game essentially as it is known today. These modern rules for the basic moves had been adopted in Italy and Spain.
        Pawns gained the option of advancing two squares on their first move, while bishops and queens acquired their modern abilities.
        The queen replaced the earlier vizier chess piece towards the end of the 10th century and by the 15th century had become the most
        powerful piece consequently modern chess was referred to as "Queen's Chess" or "Mad Queen Chess". These new rules quickly spread 
        throughout western Europe. The rules about stalemate were finalized in the early 19th century. To distinguish it from its predecessors, 
        this version of the rules is sometimes referred to as western chess or international chess.
        The first modern chess tournament was organized by Howard Staunton, a leading English chess player, and was held in London in 1851. It was
        won by the relatively unknown German Adolf Anderssen, who was hailed as the leading chess master, and his brilliant, energetic attacking
        style became typical for the time, although it was later regarded as strategically shallow. Sparkling games like Anderssen's Immortal game
        and Evergreen game or Morphy's Opera game were regarded as the highest possible summit of the chess art.</p>
