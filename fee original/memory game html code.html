       <p>The memory card game editior allows you to create memory card games with card pairs containing the same content.</p>
       <p>
        Concentration is a round game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.
        Concentration can be played with any number of players or as a solitaire or patience game. It is a particularly good game for young children, though adults may find it challenging and stimulating 
        as well. The scheme is often used in quiz shows (in fact, several game shows have used its name in their titles) and can be employed as an educational game.

       <h2>Tweaking The Flip Time</h2>
       <p>To find a matching pair of cards, you have to click on the cards of the same card pair, right after each other. If you do not find the correct pair, the cards will flip back and you can try again. The game is solved when all memory card pairs are found.
        <P> The 'Flip time' can be changed on the Settings-tab to give your puzzle players more time to interpret the content of the card.</p>
       <p>to find the pair of cards ,you have to click on the cards of the same card pair,right after each other. if you do not find the correct pair,the card will flip back and you can try again.only then the game is solved when all the cards flipped are matched.</p>
       <p>it does this by calculating the field size, the number of cards and keeps into account the minimum font size required for the cards to stay readable.</p>
       <p>this results in a nice 'responsive' memory game, playable on all devices and screen sizes</p>

        <h1>How To Play:</h1>
        <ol><li>The game starts with all the cards face down and players take turns to turn over two cards.</li>
            <li>If the two cards have the same picture, then they keep the cards, otherwise they turn the cards face down again.</li>
            <li> The winner is the person with the most cards when all the cards have been taken.</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Rules to play the game:</h1>
        <ol><li>Youngest player goes first. Players take turns, to the left, turning any two cards picture-side-up. The cards must be turned over completely, so that all players can see them.</li>
            <li><p><b>A Match:</b> A player makes a match if the two cards turned picture-side-up are identical.</p>
                <p>When a match is made, the player takes both cards and places them in front of him or her. That player then takes another turn, and continues taking turns until he or she misses.</p></li>
            <li><p><bold>A Miss:</bold> A player misses if the two cards turned over are not identical. When a player misses, he or she turns the two cards picture-side-down again, in the same place.</p>
                <p>That player's turn ends-and all players try to remember which cards were turned over, for future matches.</p></li> 
            <li>The game continues until all cards have been matched and removed from the playing area. All players then count up their matching pairs.</li>                            
        </ol>

        <ol><li><b><mark>Any Color:</b></mark> A version especially good for young children where matching pairs need only be of the same rank, not the same color. When playing with jokers, these count double because they are more difficult to match.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li><b><mark>One Flip:</b></mark> Players who make a successful pair win these cards but do not go again until their next turn.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li><b><mark>Zebra:</b></mark> Pairs may only be formed by cards of the same rank, but opposite in color (so 7 of diamonds would match with a 7 of clubs or spades, but not a 7 of hearts)</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li><b><mark>Two Decks:</b></mark> For a much longer game, shuffle together two 52-card decks and lay them out in 8 rows of 13 cards (9 rows of 12 cards if using jokers). Pairs must be identical (same rank and same suit, so the 10 of clubs would have to match the other 10 of clubs).</li> 
            &nbsp;
            <li><b><mark>Two Decks Duel:</b></mark> Duel is a two-player game where the playing field is divided into two separate parts. Each player shuffles a full 52-card deck and lays it out in 4 rows of 13 cards. The players cannot access each other's cards. Player one starts, flipping one card face-up, then player two selects one card from his/her own side. If the pair is a match, cards are removed, if not, they are flipped back. Pairs must be identical (same rank and same suit, so the 10 of clubs would have to match the other 10 of clubs). After every turn roles are exchanged, in this case: player two flips a card and player one answers.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li><b><mark>Double Decker Checkerboard:</b></mark> For a slightly easier version of the two-pack game, use decks with different backs and shuffle them separately. Deal them out in a checkerboard pattern (red, blue, red, blue, etc.) The different backs help identify the position in the grid and significantly reduce the possibility of which cards will match.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li><b><mark>Fancy:</b></mark> The cards need not be laid out in a strict rectangular grid and many players have their own special layouts that include circular, triangular, or diamond-shaped formations. Dealers may select any layout they wish.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li><b><mark>Spaghetti:</b></mark> Same rules as standard concentration, only the cards are not laid out in neat rows. They are strewn randomly about on the floor.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li><b><mark>Pexeso:</b></mark> Played with a deck of 64 cards of square shape, which are laid out into an 8*8 square. Usually cards are designed specifically for the game of Pexeso, but at the same time there is no limitation on the content of the cards (images from a cartoon shows, photographs of a historic monuments or touristic destinations, car model of a specific automobile company, etc.). Cards are not divided into any kind of value or colour system; their content consists only of 32 pairs of identical cards.</li>

        <h1>Fully Responsive Memory Cards</h1><img src="on mobile game.jpeg" alt="click here" heigth="200px" width="300px">
        <p>The memory game interface is completely responsive and tries to fit every card within one 'viewport', so that you don't have to scroll to play the game.</p>

        <p>It does this by calculating the field size, the number of cards and keeps into account the minimum font size required for the cards to stay readable.</p>
            
        <p>This results in a nice 'responsive' memory game, playable on all devices and screen sizes</p>

        

        <h1>Show Number On Cards</h1><img src="numbering on cards.jpg" alt="click here" heigth="300px" width="300px">
        <p>To accompany memory games played on a digital school board, or in a virtual meeting, the Premium option 'Show numbers on cards' was added.</p>
        <p>This way, the player can call out a number and the organiser of the virtual memory session can flip the card manually.</p>
